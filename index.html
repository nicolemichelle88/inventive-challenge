                 I’ve been interested in figuring out how things work since I was a child. I’d stare at the back pages of the encyclopedia for hours and study all of the internal human anatomy that was there (I know, I’m weird.) I majored in biology in college, and after graduation, I decided to get my Texas Teacher Certification and teach high school science, which is what I’ve done for 12 years. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After teaching for about four years, I applied and was accepted to the UH College of Optometry. Although I started that chapter of my life excited and hopeful for the future, circumstances were working against me. That same year, my mother was diagnosed with end-stage COPD and required lots of care, and simultaneously, my brother’s family hit hard times and needed help, too. The strain of trying to juggle my studies and the needs of my family eventually lead to my dismissal from the program after a year. I was devastated; my mom was terminally ill, and for the first time in my life, I had failed at something academic--not to mention the hefty student loans I now had with no pathway to an increased income to enable myself to pay them off. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Defeated and disappointed, I returned to teaching. Although I love my students and love having a positive impact on them, the lack of upward mobility and the large payment I had to now make every month made it hard to stay positive about my future. And then, on a whim, I decided to take a shot at coding. I enrolled in Austin Coding Academy and after the first class, I was hooked. I already spent hours making things in my current line of work, but unlike in the classroom, I could see automatic feedback about whether my implementations worked. And as a teacher, I’ve constantly designed things with the “user” in mind and broken complex topics down for laypersons, both of which naturally extend to web development. And the tech industry, unlike education, had the potential of upward mobility; my hard work and experience could eventually pay off, which just isn’t possible in my current career. For the first time in years, I was hopeful; coding seemed to be my pathway to a fulfilling career.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                My experience at ACA was an overall positive one, but I just haven’t managed to get hired at my current skill level, which is why I’m interested in Inventive. You guys have a level of actual industry experience that my instructors at ACA didn’t have, and the fact that you work with your students after program completion to find jobs is huge. And I absolutely LOVE that you even have a non-profit committed to helping underrepresented groups. I’m excited to build on my current skills, reinforce my weak points, and get one step closer to my new career.
